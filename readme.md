This is a starter package for building an app with Node Express, MongoDB, Sass, and more. 

It is based on the starter files for Wes Bos's fabulous course: [Learn Node](https://LearnNode.com/friend/ELIASON). 

All credit for these files should go to him!

## Basic Setup

1. Go to package.json and put in the name of your app
2. Go to /routes/index.js and put in the name of your app
3. Go to variables.env and add your database connection info
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm audit fix`
6. run `npm start`

Everything should work! If not, something is broken.
